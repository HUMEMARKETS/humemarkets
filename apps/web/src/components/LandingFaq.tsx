Options and perpetuals trade from one terminal, against one vault, sharing the same market registry, oracle router and risk engine underneath, not a spot exchange, and not two separate products bolted together.',
    },
    {
        q: 'What can I trade?',
        a: 'Perpetuals for leveraged long or short exposure on tokenized stocks like NVDA, TSLA, AAPL, META and HOOD, and European-style call and put options on the same underlyings for volatility and defined-risk positions. Every option is cash settled, no physical delivery of the underlying token, just a payout in the settlement asset at expiry.',

    {
        q: 'What chain does it run on?',
        a: `Hume runs on ${chains[env.chainId].name}, an EVM-compatible chain. Every contract address the terminal talks to is read from configuration rather than hardcoded, so the same frontend can be built for a testnet or a mainnet deployment by changing the build environment.`,

    {
        q: 'How is settlement verified?',
        a: "Every trade settles through the HumeVault contract, the one place that holds collateral, tracks locked margin and pays out realized PnL, whether that PnL comes from an option expiring, a perpetual position closing, or a funding payment. Nothing about a settlement lives off-chain waiting to be reconciled; see Smart contracts above for the vault's own address.",

        q: 'How do I verify the contracts myself?',
        a: 'Every contract Hume runs on is listed above, in full, not shortened — with a copy button and a link straight to the block explorer for that address. Open any of them and read the deployed bytecode and every transaction it has processed yourself; nothing here asks you to take our word for it.',

/// of action as everything else `interactive` marks clickable on this page, rather than a plain
/// text disclosure bolted onto a different visual language. No outer box: the row dividers are the
/// only lines here, and they carry real information (this is a list of separately clickable rows),
/// not a panel drawn around it for its own sake. Full `PAGE_FRAME` width, same as every other
/// section's own content — its left and right edges line up with Products, Markets and Smart
/// contracts above it, not a narrower column of its own.

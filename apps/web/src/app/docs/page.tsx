                            and settles the PnL. Then it takes two charges from what the owner has left: the
                            market&apos;s liquidation fee on position size, and a liquidator reward of 5% of the
                            position&apos;s margin. Together they are capped at the owner&apos;s remaining balance, so
                            a liquidation never reverts on a deeply losing position.

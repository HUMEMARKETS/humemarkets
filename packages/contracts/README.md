# @hume/contracts

Foundry + Solidity 0.8.26 + OpenZeppelin v5.1.0. Phase 1 (see `DEVELOPMENT_STEPS.md`) is implemented: interfaces, all core/oracle/risk/options/perps contracts, security pass, events, Foundry test suite, and deploy scripts. **Deployed to Robinhood Chain testnet** — see `deployments/robinhood_testnet.json` and the CHANGELOG's `[1.0.0-testnet]` entry for addresses (each confirmed live via `cast code`, not just trusted from script output). No market seeded yet — see CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` for pending follow-ups.

Not a pnpm package — intentionally excluded from the JS workspace graph.

## Setup

```bash
forge install foundry-rs/forge-std OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@v5.1.0 OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable@v5.1.0 --no-git
forge build
forge test
```

`lib/` is gitignored (vendored dependency, reproducible via the pinned versions above).

## Known MVP limitations (see CHANGELOG for full detail)

- `OracleRouter.getMarkPrice` resolves identically to `getIndexPrice` (no independent onchain mark-price source in Phase 1), so `FundingManager.updateFundingRate`'s `(mark - index)/index` is always 0 — funding is structurally inert until a real mark-price mechanism lands.
- Options are buy-only: the Vault's shared collateral pool is the implicit writer/counterparty for every option position (no explicit writer/seller role).
- No protocol-wide pause switch (per-market pause via `MarketRegistry.setActive` / `OracleRouter.pauseMarket` only).

## Deploying

```bash
export PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
export COLLATERAL_TOKEN=0x...   # deployed stable settlement asset
export NETWORK_NAME=robinhood_testnet

forge script script/DeployAll.s.sol --rpc-url robinhood_testnet --broadcast --verify
```

Writes the proxy addresses to `deployments/<NETWORK_NAME>.json` (checked into the repo as the canonical record) and the implementations to `deployments/<NETWORK_NAME>.implementations.json`, and prints a summary. Run it once per network.

## Upgrading without changing an address

Every contract is an ERC-1967 proxy (UUPS). The proxy address never changes and keeps all state; a code change is a new implementation that the proxy points at. To ship a change to a network that is already deployed:

```bash
export PRIVATE_KEY=0x... NETWORK_NAME=robinhood_testnet
python3 script/check-storage-layout.py      # the change must only append state variables
forge script script/UpgradeAll.s.sol --rpc-url robinhood_testnet --broadcast
./script/verify.sh                          # verifies the new implementations
```

`packages/config` and every client keep working: the addresses are the same. The rules for a contract change:

- Only append state variables. Never reorder, remove or retype one, or a proxy reads the wrong data after the upgrade. CI runs `script/check-storage-layout.py`; after a deliberate append run it with `--update` and commit `storage-layouts/`.
- Give a new contract an `initialize` (with the `initializer` modifier) and call `__UpgradeableBase_init(admin)`. The constructor only sets `immutable` fields and calls `_disableInitializers()`. State variables need no inline initial value: it would never run behind a proxy.
- The caller of `UpgradeAll` must hold `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`. After `HandOverAdmin.s.sol` that is the multisig or timelock, which then sends the `upgradeToAndCall` calls itself.
- A change that cannot keep the layout needs a fresh `DeployAll` (new addresses and empty state).

## Handing admin to a multisig or timelock

The deployer key starts with every admin role. Before mainnet, move them (Section 37). Run these in order, each from `packages/contracts`:

1. Grant the roles to the new admin (the deployer keeps its own, so nothing is lost if the address is wrong):

    ```bash
    export PRIVATE_KEY=0x... NETWORK_NAME=robinhood_testnet && NEW_ADMIN=0xMULTISIG forge script script/HandOverAdmin.s.sol --rpc-url robinhood_testnet --broadcast
    ```

2. From the multisig or timelock, send one admin call (for example `MarketRegistry.setActive` with the current value) and confirm it succeeds.
3. Revoke the deployer:

    ```bash
    export PRIVATE_KEY=0x... NETWORK_NAME=robinhood_testnet && NEW_ADMIN=0xMULTISIG RENOUNCE=true forge script script/HandOverAdmin.s.sol --rpc-url robinhood_testnet --broadcast
    ```

The script does not move the service keys: rotate `QUOTER_ROLE` (`OptionsEngine`) and `MAKER_ROLE` (`RFQManager`) from the new admin. `PerpsEngine` has no admin. `OracleRouter.pauseMarket` shares `ORACLE_ADMIN_ROLE` with `setPrimarySource`, so a timelock in front of that role also delays an emergency pause, and a separate fast key holding it could swap the oracle too. A separate pauser role is a contract change: decide it with product before mainnet.

/// @notice Stateless-ish price validation (staleness + deviation), kept separate from
/// OracleRouter so the rules are independently unit- and fuzz-testable (PROJECT_BRIEF.md
/// Section 16). Reverts use the exact error signatures required by Section 36.
///
/// Staleness is session-aware (`REFERENCE.md` Section 2, Finding 4). Every Chainlink feed on this
/// chain updates on a 0.5% deviation or a 24-hour heartbeat, so an equity feed is stale every night
/// and all weekend by design: measured on 2026-10-04, a Sunday, all 32 equity feeds read 35.7 to
/// 46.0 hours old. A flat one-hour limit would therefore close the venue every evening, and a flat
/// 25-hour limit would let someone trade on a day-old price. So each market carries a trading
/// session, and the market has three states rather than two:
///
/// - inside the session, a price newer than `maxPriceAge` that also belongs to the session now
///   running is `Fresh` and may be settled on;
/// - inside the session, an older price, or one carried over from an earlier session, is `Stale`, and
///   `validateFreshness` reverts `StaleOraclePrice`: the feed has broken during the hours it is
///   supposed to work;
/// - outside the session the market is `Closed`, and `validateFreshness` reverts
///   `MarketSessionClosed`, which is a normal state and not a fault. The frontend reads
///   `priceState` and renders the last price, its timestamp and a disabled ticket, the way an
///   equity venue does, instead of an oracle error.
///
/// The session floor is the rule that does the work. A feed only moves on a 0.5% deviation, so a long
/// in-session silence usually means the price has not moved: measured over three weeks of round
/// history, SPY went a whole 390-minute session without one update, and MSFT, NVDA and AAPL ran over
/// five hours. An age limit tight enough to catch a broken feed would therefore halt a quiet market
/// during its own session, and one loose enough to survive a quiet session would also admit
/// yesterday's close - the price across which the underlying can gap arbitrarily. So a price must
/// additionally be stamped at or after this session's open, less `preOpenGrace` for the feed that
/// last printed shortly before the bell (measured at up to 39 minutes after the open for the first
/// in-session print, and SPY's last pre-open print an hour before it). A previous session's price can
/// never pass, whatever `maxPriceAge` says.
///
/// A market with no session configured is always in session, which is the right default for a
/// crypto, FX or stablecoin feed: those never close, and deviation is the only thing that moves
/// them, so they take the full 24-hour tolerance through `maxPriceAge` alone.
///
/// The session window is stored in UTC, but the US equity session moves against UTC twice a year
/// (13:30-20:00 UTC under EDT, 14:30-21:00 UTC under EST). `setTradingSession` is therefore an
/// operational task on each DST boundary - the first after launch is 2026-11-01. Forgetting it is
/// conservative rather than dangerous: the window then reads open for an hour when the underlying
/// is shut, the feed is stale for that hour, and trading reverts instead of pricing off a stale
/// feed. It never widens a limit.

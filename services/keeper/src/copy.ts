/// leader's perp positions, and mirrors them into the follower's copy subaccount:
///
/// - a leader position opened after the follow began is opened in the subaccount at the leader's leverage, with
///   the follower's margin in the same proportion as the leader's margin is to the leader's balance;
/// - a mirrored position is closed when the leader's closes;
/// - a trade that would break one of the follower's caps, or that the chain refuses, is recorded as a skip with a
///   plain reason. Nothing is ever opened in part.
///
/// The executor's key can trade in the subaccount and can do nothing else: `Subaccount` lets a delegate call the
/// engines only, so it cannot withdraw. The follower revokes it on chain at any time; the delegate check runs on
/// every pass, and stopping a follow in the API takes effect at once.
